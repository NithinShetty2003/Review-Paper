# Review-Paper
Quantum computing is a groundbreaking technology that harnesses quantum mechanics principles, such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference, to process information in ways classical computers cannot. This paper provides an overview of quantum computing, starting with quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel data processing. It covers quantum gates and circuits, along with key algorithms like Shor’s algorithm for polynomial time factorization and Grover’s algorithm for quadratic speedup in search problems. 

The paper also explores quantum decoherence, error correction, and efforts to stabilize qubits. Various quantum computing models are examined, including gate-based quantum computing, quantum annealing, and topological quantum computing, with a focus on hardware architectures like superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and photonic computing. 

Applications of quantum computing in cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery are discussed, emphasizing quantum machine learning and quantum key distribution (QKD). The challenges of scalability, error correction, and quantum software development are addressed, alongside advancements made by companies like IBM, Google, and D-Wave. The paper concludes by highlighting future directions, including quantum advantage, quantum networks, and the integration of quantum computing with AI, emphasizing its transformative potential across industries like healthcare, energy, and finance.
